    requestOrder: Oh... you're here. Do you... serve tea? I guess I can have some.
      Do you have anything... um... <color=#00ffffff>blue</color>?
    ramblings:
    - You know. <color=#00ffffff>Blue</color>. Like... have you ever seen those videos...
      of the rain... being... sad?
    - I watch lots of... videos. The audio quality is like... rain from a gutter...
      because of my... teeth. They're also <color=#00ffffff>blue</color>.
    - The forecast today said it was going to rain towards the <color=#00ffffff>blue</color>
      moon. But it's raining towards the <color=#00ffffff>blue</color> sun. Awww...
    - Some people... don't really like <color=#00ffffff>blue</color>. But, I am <color=#00ffffff>blue</color>.
      The rain's <color=#00ffffff>blue</color>. My teeth are <color=#00ffffff>blue</color>.
      You just gotta have <color=#00ffffff>blue</color> sometimes.
    rateOrderBad: Oh... this makes me feel... <color=red">red</color>.
    rateOrderMid: Ahm.... mmm... I feel... <color=yellow">yellow</color>,. That's
      different.
    rateOrderGood: Oh, this is nice. I'm feeling... <color=green">Green</color>.
      It's not easy, being <color=green">green</color>.
    rateOrderPeak: <color=#00ffffff>Blue</color>. It's so... <color=#00ffffff>blue</color>.
      Thank you.

    requestOrder: Hey... it's you. ...I need friends. ...Do you have any tea that
      tastes like friends?
    ramblings:
    - 'I had some good friends, once. They really liked... Lave''s Ender. '
    - Actually, that one guy... he liked... Eye's Biscuits. But that's maybe not
      exactly what I was thinking of.
    - I hope you have lots of friends. I was wondering... do you have any... to spare?
    - Well... if you put them in the tea... does that still count? Friends, I mean.
    rateOrderBad: Oh... I think my social status just went down...
    rateOrderMid: This tastes like... one friend.
    rateOrderGood: This is... mmmm... one, two... a few friends. I like it.
    rateOrderPeak: 'It''s like... an entire friend group... in my heart. '
  greatShot:
  - Oh, that looked right... I think it was good...
  - Wow, that's tea-rific! ...Oh. Was that not funny? Oh....
